# odin-sign-up-page

By this point, I'm past learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and am now onto the intermediate parts. The first of the projects I'll be working on to flex my skills in those higher-level areas, particularly HTML and CSS, will be to make a mock sign-up form. 

For this project, I'll likely be making heavy use of forms, inputs and labels through HTML as well as pseduo-classes in CSS to allow for a dynamically changing layout as users interact with the form. I've had some experience with using inputs and buttons in past projects, particularly when I implemented a range slider to adjust the dimensions of an etch-a-sketch grid. However, this is the first time I will be squarely working with inputs to create something as fundamental to web dev as forms. 

I've heard about pesudo-classes in passing, but now that I see their potential in making for a more visually appealing form, I'm excited to test them out. Additionally, as I've also learned through my studies, I would like to try my hand in adding screen reader support to the form by making it so the inputs and labels are consicely read out for users of those devices.

I have now reached the end of this intermediate-level project. Thanks to this, I got experience in creating client-side error messages through Javascript, styling via pseduo-classes, styling with the box-shadow property, adjusting height and width via vh and vw respectively, setting a background image and of course building a form from scratch. 

As I expected, this project made for a nice refresher in HTML and CSS while also teaching me a number of new aspects of those two languages. In my own experiences in browsing the internet, I did notice how certain forms had more features than others (i.e. marking an element as valid/invalid, showing an error message prior to submission, etc.), but I now have a good grasp on how the web developers and designers are able to make those little touches happen. When I go on to make my own personal website, what I've learned here will definitely come in handy.
