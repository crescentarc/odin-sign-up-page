# odin-sign-up-page

By this point, I'm past learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript and am now onto the intermediate parts. The first of the projects I'll be working on to flex my skills in those higher-level areas, particularly HTML and CSS, will be to make a mock sign-up form. 

For this project, I'll likely be making heavy use of forms, inputs and labels through HTML as well as pseduo-classes in CSS to allow for a dynamically changing layout as users interact with the form. I've had some experience with using inputs and buttons in past projects, particularly when I implemented a range slider to adjust the dimensions of an etch-a-sketch grid. However, this is the first time I will be squarely working with inputs to create something as fundamental to web dev as forms. 

I've heard about pesudo-classes in passing, but now that I see their potential in making for a more visually appealing form, I'm excited to test them out. Additionally, as I've also learned through my studies, I would like to try my hand in adding screen reader support to the form by making it so the inputs and labels are consicely read out for users of those devices.
